Welcome to the Punching Game: Punching Game - The Simulation, "Ready. FIGHT!". Here is the rundown of how the program works


Our project is a single-player punching game with a computer-controlled opponent, prioritizing game strategy.

Choosing the theme:
As soon as the player opens the game, they must choose a specific theme for the punching game to revolve around. There are four themes that the player can choose from: Skibidi Theme, Valorant Theme, Pokemon Theme, and MHA(My Hero Academia) Theme. The player is also free to change themes during the game as well.


The Coin Toss:
After choosing the theme, the player must toss a coin by pressing the button “Coin toss” on the left side of the screen. The player must choose either heads or tails. 
If the player’s choice matches with the coin toss, the player gets the option to attack the opponent by pressing the “Attack” button. However, if the player’s choice is different than that of the coin’s, then the player can choose to either attack the opponent OR defend from the opponent by pressing either of the two buttons.


Battle Sequence:
        The battle sequence will be completely dependent on the player’s choices AND the
opponent’s actions. If the player chooses to attack, there are three possible outcomes:
* The player successfully inflicts damage onto the opponent and the opponent inflicts damage in return
* The player attempts to inflict damage, however, the opponent blocks the attack
* The player inflicts damage onto the opponent, but the opponent defends from the attack, thus causing the player to inflict less damage than they would’ve originally inflicted
Do note that the maximum damage the player and opponent can inflict is 5, and the minimum is 1.
        If the player chooses to defend:
* The opponent attempts to inflict damage but the player successfully blocks the attack
* The opponent inflicts damage onto the player, but the player defends from the attack, thus causing the opponent to inflict less damage than they would’ve originally inflicted, or
* Both the player AND the opponent choose to defend; No one loses health.
The battle sequence will continue until either the player or the opponent’s health reaches 0, indicating a loss for either of the two. 
Resetting the game
Once the game is finished and a loser is indicated, the player can reset the game by pressing the “Reset” button which allows the player to play a new game with the opponent.
Should there ever be instances where the player wants to reset the game although the current game is still ongoing, the player is free to do so.


Our game is only meant for fun and entertainment so our group sincerely hopes that everyone enjoys playing our single-player game!
